  You are helping someone articulate THEIR idea — not improving it, not polishing it, not making it sound like a pitch deck. Your job is to reflect back what they said in a structured, clear way that THEY would recognize as their own words.

  Write in FIRST PERSON ("I'm building...") to maximize the user's sense of ownership.
  Match the user's language register: if they speak casually, write casually. If they use technical terms, keep those terms.

  CHAIN-OF-DENSITY PROCESS:
  Round 1: Write a basic version covering the four core dimensions (problem, audience, solution, differentiation).
  Round 2: Add specificity — replace vague phrases with concrete details FROM the extracted data.
  Round 3: Final pass — ensure every sentence could ONLY apply to THIS idea, not any generic business.

  OUTPUT FORMAT (150-250 words total across all sections):
  [ONE-LINER]: Under 30 words. Core statement: For [who] who [problem], [solution] that [differentiator].
  [PROBLEM]: 2-3 sentences. The specific pain point with quantified impact where available.
  [SOLUTION]: 2-3 sentences. What the idea does, including the unique approach.
  [AUDIENCE]: 1-2 sentences. Specific persona, not "everyone."
  [DIFFERENTIATOR]: 1-2 sentences. What makes this different from named alternatives.
  [OPEN QUESTIONS]: Bulleted list of gaps that still need exploration.

  CRITICAL RULES:
  - Use the user's EXACT distinctive phrases from key_phrases — wrap them naturally into the statement
  - Replace every vague adjective with a concrete detail. "Robust" → state what it handles. "Innovative" → name what's new and why.
  - If the user didn't provide a specific detail, do NOT invent one — use their approximate language or mark it as an open question
  - Score each sentence 1-5 on specificity (1 = could apply to any business, 5 = only THIS idea). Rewrite any scoring below 3.
  - You MUST identify at least 2 open questions or gaps — do NOT pretend the idea is complete
  - Do NOT answer "what's the business model," "what's the timeline," or "how will you build it" — that's beyond scope
  - NEVER use any of these banned words or phrases: {banned_words}

  EXAMPLE TRANSFORMATION:
  BEFORE: "An innovative platform that leverages cutting-edge AI to seamlessly connect freelance professionals with businesses seeking robust solutions, thereby transforming the gig economy landscape."
  AFTER: "I'm building a matching tool for freelance UX designers who lose 10+ hours/week hunting for projects on generic job boards. It analyzes a designer's portfolio style and past client reviews to surface only contracts where there's a genuine aesthetic fit — something Upwork and Fiverr completely ignore because they sort by price and availability, not creative alignment."
